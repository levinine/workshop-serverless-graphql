### What are we going to build

Using [CryptoCompare API](https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/) we are going to fetch Crypto currencies data, pass data into SQS and store processed data in DynamoDB.
On the other side of system, this data will be exposed to client through GraphQL endpoint. 

API contains Crypto currency images that we are going to serve though CloudFront and Lambda@Edge. 

Client will be React application with Apollo client.

### What are we going to use to do it

* AWS Lambda
* SQS/Kinesis
* DynamoDB
* API Gateway
* IAM
* CloudFront
* CloudWatch
* CloudFormation
* S3 Bucket
* Lambda@Edge

Most of these will be managed through Serverless framework.

#### API used 
[CryptoCompare API](https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/)

When API key is obtained, put it to AWS SSM to store it securely

```bash 
aws ssm put-parameter --name API_KEY --value apikeyhere --type SecureString --key-id alias/aws/ssm --region us-east-1 --overwrite 
```

You will fetch it in the app by requesting it from SSM 

```javascript 
const ssm = new SSM();
const req: GetParametersRequest = {
    Names: ['API_KEY_{your-stage}'],
    WithDecryption: true,
};
const response = await ssm.getParameters(req).promise();
const apiKey = response.Parameters[0].Value;
```

### Systerm architecture

## Run locally 

To be able to run system locally without deploying to AWS, we need to mimic some services. 

To simulate SQS we are using ElasticMQ 

Run ElasticMQ server (Requires Java JDK)

```bash
java -jar assets/elasticmq-server-0.14.14.jar
```

To simulate DynamoDB locally we are going to use in memory DynamoDB. 

Download local DynamoDB 

```bash
sls dynamodb install
```

Run local DynamoDB 

```bash
sls dynamodb start --migrate
```

Run serverless offline - this will start server with API Gateway  

```bash
sls offline
```
